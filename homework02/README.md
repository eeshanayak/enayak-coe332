# Read Animals

The read_animals.py script breeds 2 randomly generated animals as parents into a child by combining their traits.

## Download Script
Download the script by using git clone command with the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/eeshanayak/enayak-coe332
```
Then navigate to the homework02 folder
```
cd enayak-coe332
cd homework02
```

## Generate Animals
The generate_animals.py script generates a dictionary with the key “animals” and a value of a list of dictionaries, each dictionary representing an animal with a randomly generated “head” from a set of choices, randomly generated “body” from the pentname library, and random number of “arms” and “legs” which add up to the “tail”. The dictionary is dumped into a json file specified by the user. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
To use the generate_animals.py script, use a python3 compiler to run “generate_animals.py” and specify the name of the json file you would like to write to.

## Read Animals
The read_animals.py script reads in the json file generated by the generate_animals.py script and breeds two randomly chosen dictionaries as parents into a child by combining their traits.

## Dockerfile
<<<<<<< HEAD
To build the Dockerfile, use the docker build command and tag it with your Docker Hub username and a descriptive name and code version
```
docker build -t eeshanayak/json-parser:1.0 .
=======
To build the Dockerfile, use the docker build command and tag it with a descriptive name and code version
```
docker build -t json-parser:1.0 .
>>>>>>> beda28b5c9a18827a4d81efff6ab011acf8f2a1d
```

To run the interactive container, use the docker run command with the container you built, and use the “—rm” flag to remove the container when you exit it and the “-it” flag to attach an interactive container inside the terminal
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
docker run --rm -it eeshanayak/json-parser:1.0 /bin/bash
```

Inside the container, you don’t need to specify the compiler, so you can run 
=======
docker run --rm -it json-parser:1.0 /bin/bash
```

Inside the container, you don’t need to specify the interpreter, so you can run 
>>>>>>> beda28b5c9a18827a4d81efff6ab011acf8f2a1d
```
generate_animals.py animals.json
read_animals.py animals.json
```

To exit the interactive container, press ctrl+d

If you would like to run the code non-interactively, run the docker run command on the command line without the “-it” flag and include the parameters for where the files will be stored and read from 
<<<<<<< HEAD
