ead Animals

The read_animals.py script breeds 2 randomly generated animals as parents into a child by combining their traits

## Generate Animals
The generate_animals.py script generates a dictionary with the key “animals” and a value of a list of dictionaries, each dictionary representing an animal with a randomly generated “head” from a set of choices, randomly generated “body” from the pentname library, and random number of “arms” and “legs” which add up to the “tail”. The dictionary is dumped into a json file specified by the user. 

To use the generate_animals.py script, use a python3 compiler to run “generate_animals.py” and specify the name of the json file you would like to write to.
```python3 generate_animals.py animals.json```

## Read Animals
The read_animals.py script reads in the json file generated by the generate_animals.py script and breeds two randomly chosen dictionaries as parents into a child by combining their traits. 

To use the read_animals.py script, use a python3 compiler to run “read_animals.py” and specify the name of the json that was written from the generate_animals.py script.
```python3 read_animals.py animals.json```


## Dockerfile
To build the Dockerfile, use the docker build command and tag it with your Docker Hub username and a descriptive name and code version
docker build -t eeshanayak/json-parser:1.0 .

To run the interactive container, use the docker run command with the container you built, and use the “—rm” flag to remove the container when you exit it and the “-it” flag to attach an interactive container inside the terminal
```docker run --rm -it eeshanayak/json-parser:1.0 /bin/bash```

Inside the container, you don’t need to specify the compiler, so you can run 
```generate_animals.py animals.json
read_animals.py animals.json
```

If you would like to run the code non-interactively, run the docker run command on the command line without the “-it” flag and include the parameters for where the files will be stored and read from 
```docker run --rm -v $PWD:/data eeshanayak/json-parser:1.0 read_animals.py /data/animals.json```

To run the unit tests for these scripts, use a python3 compiler to run the “test_read_animals.py”
```python3 test_read_animals.py```
