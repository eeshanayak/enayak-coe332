## Grocery Store Shelf FIFO Model

This app simulates how perishable food items are shelved at grocery stores and tracks how much gets thrown away due to expiration, given the stock and sales data for a time period. It is assumed in this model that the items are sold in priority of earliest expiration.

For example assuming this was the raw data for a cheesecake

| Day | Stock | Sales |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 |	5 | 2 |
| 1 | 3 | 4 |
| 2 | 4 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 | 0 |
